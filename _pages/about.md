# About SCHH Commons

**SCHH Commons** is a community-driven initiative created by and for residents of Sun City Hilton Head. The goal is to make it easier for neighbors to discover, share, and use resources that enrich life in our community.

This site is **not affiliated with Pulte, the developer of Sun City Hilton Head, nor with the HOA or any official organization**. Instead, SCHH Commons is a grassroots effort—built by residents, for residents.

## What We Do

* **Resource Sharing** – The site is used to collect, organize, and share information that helps residents navigate Sun City Hilton Head, from clubs and activities to local services and community knowledge.
* **Knowledge Base** – At the heart of SCHH Commons is a growing knowledge base built from both official community documents and resident-contributed information. This knowledge powers tools like our SCHH chatbot.
* **Technology Tools** – The site leverages technology to make resources more accessible. Current technology-driven features include an AI chatbot, interactive maps, podcasts, and an interactive events calendar.
* **Community Contributions** – Residents are encouraged to share documents, tips, and insights that others might find useful.

## Why It Matters

Sun City Hilton Head is a large and vibrant community, but information is scattered across different platforms and sometimes difficult to access. SCHH Commons makes it easier to:

* Quickly find reliable information.
* Discover new opportunities and activities.
* Contribute your own knowledge and experiences to benefit others.
* Explore how new technologies—like AI—can make community life easier.

## Our Principles

* **Open & Inclusive** – Resources are meant for all SCHH residents and prospective residents.
* **Transparent** – While we make every effort to ensure accuracy, errors can occur—especially with AI-generated content. Always verify important details with official sources.
* **Complementary** – Our tools do not replace official Sun City information channels. They are meant as conveniences that make it easier to find, use, and understand that information.
* **Community-Grown** – SCHH Commons will grow as more residents contribute their time, knowledge, and ideas.

## A Note on AI

SCHH Commons makes use of the latest AI technology. The chatbots can answer questions about community life, provide summaries, and help residents learn about upcoming events. The Chatbots are powered by  a local knowledge base making it a flexible tool for everyday questions.

While the chatbot is focused on Sun City Hilton Head, it’s built on tools that reflect a much larger shift in how people will access and use information in the years ahead.
