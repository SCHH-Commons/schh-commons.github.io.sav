# Welcome

Welcome to SCHH Commons, a neighbor-supported project designed to bring together resources, knowledge, and experiences that make life in Sun City Hilton Head easier and more enjoyable. This site is not official—it’s simply a community effort to collect, organize, and share helpful information, from practical how‑tos and curated documents to maps, guides, and stories contributed by residents.
